/*
Note :
## 1st way
> We can create a class file and then create a object file
> create the obj as shown above

## 2nd way
> We can create a class file and write all the required methods inside it
> then create the object in the same file
> eg. /Users/akshay.joshi/Assigments/scala_learning_project/LEARNING/src/main/scala/scala_oops/scala_cls1.scala


## Third way
> here we are not creating any class explicitly, just creating an object inside which all the method have been defined
and also the main method
